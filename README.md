# Jumphigher
 
 
A top-down game that is time-based and increases speed as you get more score. You can jump from platform to platform and the longer you survive the faster it gets. There are monsters that will kill you if you run into them, powerups, different types of platforms, and springs on some platforms occasionally. Survive as long as you can and get the highest score.
